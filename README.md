Deckerino
=============
Deckerino (currently in beta) is a deck/builder manager for Hearthstone. You can use Deckerino to keep track of your decks, share decks easily with friends, and 'track' your deck during play.
* Create and manage decks with the latest cards, including Curse of Naxxaramas (soon, Goblins vs. Gnomes!)
* Track your decks during play, helping you to keep track of which cards have been played and which are yet to be drawn
* Works great for tablet and phone
